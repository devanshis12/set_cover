Minimum Set Cover - Branch and Bound Algorithm

This file implements an exact Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm to solve the Minimum Set Cover problem.
The objective is to identify the smallest number of subsets whose union covers all elements in the universe.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm Overview:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Branch and Bound systematically explores the solution space using depth-first search (DFS), 
while pruning branches that cannot yield better solutions than the current best. 

- Initial upper bound: We compute a greedy approximate solution (O(log n) approximation) to set the initial upper bound.
- Lower bound estimation: For pruning, we estimate the minimum number of additional subsets needed to cover the remaining elements using a greedy heuristic.
- Pruning: Any branch with lower bound â‰¥ current best is discarded.
- Recursion continues until all possible branches are explored or the cutoff time is reached.

This method guarantees an exact solution but is exponential in the worst case.
To manage runtime, the search is bounded by a time limit.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Inputs:
- A text file describing the universe and its collection of subsets
  (same format as used in approx.py).

--------------------------------------------------------------
Outputs:
- .sol file containing the size and indices of the selected subsets
- .trace file logging (time, cost) whenever a better solution is found

--------------------------------------------------------------
Example Usage:
    python3 bnb.py -inst ../data/small1.in -alg BnB -time 600

Assumptions:
- The input parser and approximation algorithm (used for initial bound) are in approx.py
- Subsets are represented as sets of elements (e.g., set([1, 2, 3]))
- The approx_msc, parse_instance and write_output functions are available from approx.py
